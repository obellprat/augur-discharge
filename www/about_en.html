<h4>About</h4>

AUGUR Discharge is a hydrological model for quantifying flood discharges with different return periods. It is based on the SCS methodology and requires basic data such as drainage area, runoff factor, time of concentration and rainfall. The input data for precipitation are taken from the AUGUR-Precipitation application (www.augur.world).

The model is used for catchment sizes between 5 - 300 km2. The model calibration was performed on a total of 40 measured catchments in Switzerland and Chile. AUGUR Discharge is the result of a collaboration between SDC, Swiss Red Cross and the University of Bern.
